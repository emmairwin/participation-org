#Rapid Prototyping

Based on the "Rapid Prototyping Talk by Tom Chi - Build effective, cutting-edge product prototypes in support of an ongoing innovation process.

###Session Objectives

* Apply Design Thinking principals to a "real world" design problem (paper airplanes)

###Learning Objectives

* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Design Thinking, and how best to apply it when prototyping.

##Agenda

1. Intro presentation about Design Thinking and rapid prototyping
2. Design Challenge, Use rapid prototyping to make a paper airplane that flies the furthest.
3. Have teams come up and talk about their process. What worked, what didn't work for making plane better.
4. Contest: see whose plane flies the furthest (more for fun than about Design Thinking)

##Notes

* Teams didn't work too well, most people wanted to make paper airplanes on their own (which is fine)
* Make sure teams document everything (what is their hypothesis, how far did each plan fly, how many iterations did they make, etc.)
* Have a dedicated space for flying and measuring plane distance, otherwise someone will lose an eye
* In the end, a crumpled wad of paper won our competition. This is a nice teaching device for making hypothesis that challenge the nature of the game
